## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSAs) are fundamental to writing efficient code and solving complex problems. This challenge aims to guide you through a 90-day journey of continuous learning and practice. Each day, you will tackle a new problem, covering various topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more.

## Challenge Structure

The challenge is divided into three phases, each lasting 30 days:

Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Warm-up with basic data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues).

Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Dive into intermediate data structures (trees, heaps, hash tables).

Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Master advanced topics (graph algorithms, dynamic programming).
